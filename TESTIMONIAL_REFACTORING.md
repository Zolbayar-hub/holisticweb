# Testimonial Refactoring

## Overview
The testimonial functionality has been extracted from `flask_app.py` into a separate blueprint located at `routes/testimony.py`.

## What was moved:

### From `flask_app.py`:
- `submit_testimonial()` route - moved to `testimony.py` as `/testimonials/submit`
- Testimonial query logic in home route - replaced with `get_approved_testimonials()` helper function

### From `routes/admin.py`:
- All testimonial admin routes (approve, disapprove, feature, edit, create, delete)
- Moved to `testimony.py` under `/testimonials/admin/` prefix

## New Route Structure:

### Public Routes:
- `/testimonials/submit` - Public testimonial submission form (previously `/submit-testimonial`)
- `/submit-testimonial` - Backward compatibility redirect to new route

### Admin Routes:
- `/testimonials/admin` - List all testimonials (previously `/admin/testimonials`)
- `/testimonials/admin/approve/<id>` - Approve testimonial
- `/testimonials/admin/disapprove/<id>` - Disapprove testimonial  
- `/testimonials/admin/feature/<id>` - Toggle featured status
- `/testimonials/admin/edit/<id>` - Edit testimonial
- `/testimonials/admin/create` - Create new testimonial
- `/testimonials/admin/delete/<id>` - Delete testimonial

## Benefits:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Testimonial functionality is now isolated
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend testimonial features
3. **Code Organization**: Cleaner main app file
4. **Reusability**: Testimonial blueprint can be easily reused in other projects

## Files Modified:
- Created: `routes/testimony.py`
- Modified: `flask_app.py` (removed testimonial code, added blueprint registration)
- Modified: `routes/admin.py` (removed testimonial routes)

## Backward Compatibility:
All existing URLs continue to work through redirect routes.
