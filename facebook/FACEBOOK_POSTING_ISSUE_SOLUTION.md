# Facebook Posting Issue - Diagnosis and Solution

## Current Status ✅
- Script runs successfully without errors
- Credentials file is loaded correctly
- Can retrieve page information (page name, about, fans, followers)

## The Problem ❌
**Error**: 403 Forbidden when trying to post to Facebook page

**Root Cause**: The access token lacks the required permissions for posting to a Facebook page.

## Required Permissions Missing
According to Facebook's error message, posting to a page requires:
1. `pages_read_engagement` permission
2. `pages_manage_posts` permission
3. User must be an admin of the page with sufficient administrative permissions

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Token Status
The current access token appears to be a user access token, but for posting to pages, you need a **Page Access Token** with proper permissions.

### Step 2: Get Proper Permissions
To fix this, you need to:

1. **Go to Facebook Developers Console**: https://developers.facebook.com/
2. **Navigate to your app** (App ID: 792639660013996)
3. **Request the following permissions**:
   - `pages_read_engagement`
   - `pages_manage_posts`
   - `pages_show_list` (to list pages)

### Step 3: Generate New Page Access Token
1. Use the Graph API Explorer: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
2. Select your app
3. Request these permissions: `pages_read_engagement,pages_manage_posts,pages_show_list`
4. Generate a User Access Token with these permissions
5. Use this User Access Token to get a Page Access Token:

```bash
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/me/accounts?access_token=YOUR_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

6. This will return page access tokens for pages you manage
7. Use the page access token in your creds.json file

### Step 4: Verify Page Admin Status
Make sure you are an admin of the Facebook page (ID: 856922244162457) with sufficient permissions to post content.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Facebook Business API
Consider using Facebook Business API which might have different permission requirements.

### Option 2: Manual Posting
For testing purposes, you can manually verify the token works by testing it in Graph API Explorer.

### Option 3: App Review Process
If this is for production use, you may need to submit your app for Facebook's App Review process to get approval for these permissions.

## Testing the Fix
Once you have the proper page access token:
1. Update the `page_access_token` in `creds.json`
2. Run `python3 post.py`
3. The posting should work successfully

## Current Working Features ✅
- Page information retrieval
- Credential loading
- Error handling and debugging
- Image posting capability (when permissions are fixed)

## Note
Facebook's API and permission system changes frequently. Make sure to check the latest Facebook Developer documentation for any updates to required permissions or API changes.
